    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <div id='about'>
        <p class='about'>I have started a new Journey in my life. A Journey that began fifteen years ago, but was set aside after five months. I've spent the past twelve years trying to figure out what in the world I want to do with my life... I am a firm believer that if you love your job, it won't ever feel like an obligatory, soul sucking task. I spent this twelve years moving from job to job trying to figure out what career I would enjoy doing. This entire time I had never considered reconsidering a career I had rejected in the past. When I was in high school. I took a webmastering class. It was so much fun, I loved building websites, but at that time I couldn't imagine it being a career. I have decided to return to this path because I need to learn a skill. I have noticed that more and more menial jobs are being taken over by automation and robots. It will only be a matter of time before all unskilled labor can be performed by machines. So, I thought, "How cool would it be if I learned software engineering so I could eventually be a part of developing robots." A few other events occured in a series of events that eventually led me back to this path.
